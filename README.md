# EO-demos

These Earth Observation satellite demonstration notebooks were created to support general users. I hope that you find these notebooks useful and inspiring so you want to learn more about Earth Observation, GIS and science applications. The notebooks use data from the MS Planetary Computer and are set up to run on a local computing environment (e.g., laptop). Examples include Landsat Scene Viewer with Cloud Filtering, Sentinel-2 Scene Viewer with Cloud Filtering, Sentinel-1 Radar Scene Viewer, Sentinel-1 Water Detection, and TerraClimate weather data.
