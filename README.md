Earth Observation Satellite Demonstration Notebooks
These notebooks were created to support general satellite Earth Observation users. The notebooks use data from the MS Planetary Computer and are set up to run on a local computing environment (e.g., laptop). Examples include Landsat Scene Viewer with Cloud Filtering, Sentinel-2 Scene Viewer with Cloud Filtering, Sentinel-1 Radar Scene Viewer, Sentinel-1 Water Detection, and TerraClimate weather data.
